This is essentially a comprehensive system for managing medications within a hospital, tracking everything from when drugs enter the hospital to when they reach the patient. Here's the core functionality:

1. Medicine & Inventory Management
- Tracks all medicines using unique barcodes
- Categorizes medicines (tablets, syrups, etc.)
- Monitors stock levels and alerts when supplies are low
- Records transactions with suppliers
- Manages expiry dates and batch numbers

2. Staff Management
- Maintains records of doctors, nurses, and pharmacy staff
- Tracks which department/field each staff member belongs to
- Records who prescribes and dispenses medications

3. Patient Care
- Stores patient information and medical history
- Tracks hospital admissions and discharges
- Manages prescriptions and medication schedules
- Creates detailed dosage schedules (when to take which medicine)
- Logs every dose given to patients
