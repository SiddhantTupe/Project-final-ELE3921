This is essentially a comprehensive system for managing medications within a hospital.
here's the core functionality:

1. Medicine
- Categorizes medicines (tablets, syrups, etc.)

2. Staff Management
- Maintains records of doctors, nurses, and pharmacy staff
- Tracks which department/field each staff member belongs to
- Records who prescribes and dispenses medications

3. Patient Care
- Stores patient information and medical history
- Tracks hospital admissions and discharges
- Manages prescriptions and medication schedules
- Creates detailed dosage schedules (when to take which medicine)
- Messaging system between assistant doctors and patients


This app delves into the medical field and focuses especially on the little details in a hospital. For example, a patient enters a hospital because they're sick (logs in to the website). Then they can add their own information through a sign-up page including basic details such as gender, blood group etc. Similarly, there are unique functions for each role namely Doctors & Assistant doctors. Although it's an application on a pretty small scale, it aims to minimize the time and effort required in curing a patient through virtual care.
